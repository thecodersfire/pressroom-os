# Built-in features for pressroom-os

Purpose: desktop publishing

1. **prepare a creative project** — run pressroom-os-workspace. It creates ~/Documents/pressroom-os-workspace/ with Briefs, Working Files, Exports folders.
2. **plan a production session** — run pressroom-os-plan to open a purpose-specific Markdown plan, saved under ~/Documents/pressroom-os-session-plans/.
